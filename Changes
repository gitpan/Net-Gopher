Revision history for Perl extension Net::Gopher.

0.78 - POD changes in each module.

0.77 - This version incorporates a wealth of new functionality into
       Net::Gopher, including:

       (a)
           A  new  class,  Net::Gopher::Response,  is   used   to   encapsulate
           requests. This class has accessor methods to modify  every  relevant
           aspect of a Gopher/Gopher+ request, as well  as  named  constructors
           you can import for each type of request.

       (b)
           The Net::Gopher connect() and disconnect()  methods  are  gone.  The
           request() method now takes care of connecting and  disconnecting  by
           itself.

       (c)
           The request() method now takes a Net::Gopher::Request object as  its
           first argument. In addition, it  takes  the  parameters  "File"  and
           "Callback," with the first specifying  a  file  where  the  response
           content should be outputted to, and the other, a reference to a  sub
           that will be called as the response is collected.

       (d)
           The request_url() method is gone.

       (e)
           Net::Gopher  now  has  the  Net::Gopher::Request  shortcut   methods
           gopher(), gopher_plus(), item() and directory().

       (f)
           _get_buffer() is gone, replaced with _read() to do all reading,  and
           a new function, _write(), used to do all writing.

       (g)
           The code to generate the request string from the parameters or  from
           a URL has been moved to Net::Gopher::Request.

       (h)
           All   response   content-modifying   code   has   been   moved    to
           Net::Gopher::Response,    which    means    _unescape    is    gone.
           Net::Gopher::Response now has the  methods  _convert_newlines()  and
           _clean_period_termination() to do that work.

       (i)
           Net::Gopher::Response  now  has  the   convenient   is_gopher_plus()
           method and the is_text() method.

       (j)
           Added check_params()  routine  to  Net::Gopher::Utility.  This  will
           ensure that param names are not misspelled, raising an error if  the
           user supplies an invalid parameter name when calling a method.

0.57 - Added new Net::Gopher::Response::Blocks class and moved all block  value
       manipulation methods  to  there.  All  newlines  are  now  converted  to
       standard Unix linefeed characters in the response content.

0.47 - Removed  the  ADMIN,  ASK,  INFO,  and  VIEWS  block  parsing  from  the
       _parse_blocks() method and  put  them  into  separate  as_admin_block(),
       as_ask_block(),    as_info_block(),    and    as_views_block()   methods
       respectively. Also, changed the key for  Gopher+  strings  in  the  hash
       returned by as_menu() from 'gopher+' to 'gopher_plus'.

0.43 - You can now specify a which item  you  want  for  directory_blocks()  by
       its selector, hostname, port, etc., in addition to its number. Fixed the
       typo in request_url() for the default scheme, and changed  request_url()
       to die when you specify an invalid scheme.

0.40 - The Net::Gopher::Response attribute information methods now  also  parse
       Gopher+ +ASK blocks. The is_menu() method  is  now  far  more  accurate.
       Also, request() now defaults to item type 1 (menu) if you don't  specify
       the 'Type' named parameter.

0.37 - Added  named  parameters  to  the  Net::Gopher  constructor: BufferSize,
       GopherPlus, and Debug. Added  debugging,  which  causes  Net::Gopher  to
       print out various diagnostic messages at different times. Also  added  a
       corresponding  debug()  method.  The  POD  has  also  been substantially
       improved. Also refractored request(), and improved the error checking.

0.35 - Improved the error checking  in  request().  Also,  request()  now  more
       efficiently handles Gopher+ responses  with  content  lengths (a  number
       denoting the length of the response in bytes as opposed to -1 or -2).

0.34 - The request() method now removes the period on a line by itself  in  the
       response content if Type is supplied and isn't 0  or  1.  Also,  periods
       escaped by adding and extra period (e.g., '..' instead of '.'), are  now
       unescaped in the response content.

0.33 - The request_url() now properly returns a Net::Gopher::response object if
       if fails to connect to the server. Also fixed a typo in  the  POD  which
       had (until now) gone unnoticed.

0.32 - Added new is_menu() and is_blocks() methods.

0.30 - Removed as_block() and replaced it with item_blocks(), and added the new
       directory_blocks()  and  as_blocks()  methods.  Also   refractored   the
       request_url() method.

0.27 - Refractored  request()  and   removed   the  _get_gopher_response()  and
       _get_gopher_plus_response() methods.
