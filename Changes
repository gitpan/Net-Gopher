Revision history for Perl extension Net::Gopher.

0.43 - You can now specify a which item  you  want  for  directory_blocks()  by
       its selector, hostname, port, etc., in addition to its number. Fixed the
       typo in request_url() for the default scheme, and changed  request_url()
       to die when you specify an invalid scheme.

0.40 - The Net::Gopher::Response attribute information methods now  also  parse
       Gopher+ +ASK blocks. The is_menu() method  is  now  far  more  accurate.
       Also, request() now defaults to item type 1 (menu) if you don't  specify
       the 'Type' named parameter.

0.37 - Added  named  parameters  to  the  Net::Gopher  constructor: BufferSize,
       GopherPlus, and Debug. Added  debugging,  which  causes  Net::Gopher  to
       print out various diagnostic messages at different times. Also  added  a
       corresponding  debug()  method.  The  POD  has  also  been substantially
       improved. Also refractored request(), and improved the error checking.

0.35 - Improved the error checking  in  request().  Also,  request()  now  more
       efficiently handles Gopher+ responses  with  content  lengths (a  number
       denoting the length of the response in bytes as opposed to -1 or -2).

0.34 - The request() method now removes the period on a line by itself  in  the
       response content if Type is supplied and isn't 0  or  1.  Also,  periods
       escaped by adding and extra period (e.g., '..' instead of '.'), are  now
       unescaped in the response content.

0.33 - The request_url() now properly returns a Net::Gopher::response object if
       if fails to connect to the server. Also fixed a typo in  the  POD  which
       had (until now) gone unnoticed.

0.32 - Added new is_menu() and is_blocks() methods.

0.30 - Removed as_block() and replaced it with item_blocks(), and added the new
       directory_blocks()  and  as_blocks()   method.   Also   refractored  the
       request_url() method.

0.27 - Refractored  request()  and   removed   the  _get_gopher_response()  and
       _get_gopher_plus_response() methods.
