Revision history for Perl extension Net::Gopher.

0.33 - The request_url() now properly returns a Net::Gopher::response object if
       if fails to connect to the server. Also fixed a typo in  the  POD  which
       had (until now) gone unnoticed.

0.32 - Added new is_menu() and is_blocks() methods.

0.30 - Removed as_block() and replaced it with item_blocks(), and added the new
       directory_blocks()  and  as_blocks()   method.   Also   refractored  the
       request_url() method.

0.27 - Refractored  request()  and   removed   the  _get_gopher_response()  and
       _get_gopher_plus_response() methods.
