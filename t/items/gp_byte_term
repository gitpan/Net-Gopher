2.3     Gopher+ data transfer.If a client sends out a Gopher+ type request to aserver (by  tagging on a tab and a "+" to therequest):        bar selectorF+The server may return the response in one of threeways; examples  below:  +5340<CRLF><data>  +-1<CRLF><data><CRLF>.<CRLF>  +-2<CRLF><data>The first response means: I am going to send exactly5340 bytes at you and they will begin right after thisline.  The second response means: I have no idea howmany bytes I  have to send (or I am lazy), but I willsend a period on a  line by itself when I am done.The  third means:  I really  have no idea how manybytes I have to send, and what's more,  they COULDcontain the <CRLF>.<CRLF> pattern, so just read untilI close  the connection.The first character of a response to a Gopher+ querydenotes  success (+) or failure (-). Following that isa token to be  interpreted as a decimal number. If thenumber is >= 0, it  describes the length of thedataBlock. If = -1, it means the  data is periodterminated. If = -2, it means the data ends  when theconnection closes.The server may return an error also, as in:--1<CRLF><data><CRLF>.<CRLF>The (short!) error message will be in ASCII text inthe data part.  The first token on the  first line ofthe error text (data) contains an error-code  (aninteger).  It is recommended that the first line alsocontain  the e-mail address of the administrator ofthe  server (in angle brackets). Both the error-codeand the email address may easily be  extracted by theclient.  Subsequent lines contain a short  errormessage that may be displayed to the user. Basic errorcodes are:        1       Item is not available.        2       Try again later ("eg.  My load is too highright now.")        3       Item has moved.  Following the error-code isthe  gopher descriptor                of where it now lives.More error codes may be defined as the need arises.This should be obvious: if the client sends out an"old"  Gopher kind of request:    bar selectorthe server will know that it is talking to an oldclient and  will respond in the old way. This meansthat old gopher  clients can still access informationon Gopher+ servers.2.4     Gopher+ client requests.Clients can send requests to retrieve the contents ofan item in this form:        selectorstringF+[representation][FdataFlag]<CRLF>[datablock]If dataFlag is '0', or nonexistent, then the clientwill not  send any data besides the selector string.If the dataFlag  is '1' then a block of data willfollow in the same format as Section 2.3.  The  clientcan send a large amount of data to the server in thedataBlock.  Representations or alternative views of anitem's contents may be discovered by interrogating theserver about the item's attribute information; this isexplained below.Note that in the original Gopher protocol, a querysubmitted to an index server might have a selectorstring followed by a TAB and the words for which theindex server was being asked to search. In Gopher+,the extra TAB and Gopher+ information follow the wordsfor which the server is being asked to search. Gopher+client have to be smart enough to know that in thecase of a type 7 item (an index server) they appendthe Gopher+ information after the words being searchedfor.
