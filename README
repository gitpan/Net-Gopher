Net::Gopher, version 1.10 (STABLE).
===============================================================================


INTRODUCTION


Net::Gopher is the Perl Gopher/Gopher+ API. This library  will  enable  you  to
communicate with Gopher and Gopher+ servers using Perl. To  get  started  using
Net::Gopher, use the following commands after installation:
 $ perldoc Net::Gopher
 $ perldoc Net::Gopher::Request
 $ perldoc Net::Gopher::Response
 $ perldoc Net::Gopher::Response::MenuItem
 $ perldoc Net::Gopher::Response::InformationBlock
 $ perldoc Net::Gopher::Constants


INSTALLATION


Install Net::Gopher as you would most other modules:
 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make
 $ make test
 $ make install

You can also use Module::Build instead of GNU Make:
 $ perl Build.PL
 $ perl Build
 $ perl Build test
 $ perl Build install


PREREQUISITES


Net::Gopher requires these modules:
 IO::String (at least version 1.0);
 IO::Socket (not really sure on this one... 1.26 should be OK);
 IO::Socket::INET (again, not really sure. 1.25 and up);
 URI (at least version 1.27);


TESTING


The new test suite that comes with Net::Gopher as of  0.92  has  its  own  test
server. This server tries to listen on what ever ports  your  OS  will  let  it
listen on. If you have some kind of firewall or port  blocking  enabled,  tests
that require this server may inexplicably fail  when  you  "make  test".  Also,
live.t contains live tests that will be done using real-world  Gopherspaces  if
you're connected to the Internet. If these sites are  down  or  malfunctioning,
this tests will inexplicably fail too.
