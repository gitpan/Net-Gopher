Net::Gopher, version 0.93 (BETA).
===============================================================================


INTRODUCTION


Net::Gopher is the Perl Gopher/Gopher+ API. This library  will  enable  you  to
communicate with Gopher and Gopher+ servers using Perl. To  get  started  using
Net::Gopher, use the following commands after installation:
 $ perldoc Net::Gopher
 $ perldoc Net::Gopher::Request
 $ perldoc Net::Gopher::Response
 $ perldoc Net::Gopher::Response::MenuItem
 $ perldoc Net::Gopher::Response::InformationBlock
 $ perldoc Net::Gopher::Constants


INSTALLATION


Install Net::Gopher as you would most other modules:
 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make
 $ make test
 $ make install

You can also use Module::Build instead of GNU Make:
 $ perl Build.PL
 $ perl Build
 $ perl Build test
 $ perl Build install


PREREQUISITES


Net::Gopher requires these modules:
 IO::String (at least version 1.0);
 IO::Socket (not really sure on this one... 1.26 should be OK);
 IO::Socket::INET (again, not really sure. 1.25 and up);
 URI (at least version 1.27);
 XML::Writer (at least version 0.4);


TESTING


The new test suite that comes with Net::Gopher as of  0.92  has  its  own  test
server. This server runs on ports 70 and 80, so  make  sure  you  have  nothing
listening on them when you "make test". Also, live.t contains live  tests  that
will be done using  real-world  Gopher  servers  if  you're  connected  to  the
Internet.  If  these  sites  are  down  or  malfunctioning,  this  tests   will
inexplicably fail.
