========================

after installation.


INSTALLATION


To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


ON TESTING


Since  Net::Gopher  is  a  network  library,  all of the tests that come with
Net::Gopher  interact  with  other  machines--Gopher servers--over a network.
What this means is that if one of the machines tested is  down,  then  all of
the tests for that machine will fail. If this happens,  look  in  the  /tests
directory for the corresponding *.t file and get the hostname from the  first
line and attempt to connect to it manually using  some  other  Gopher  client
(Lynx, Netscape 4x, etc.) to make sure the site  is  really  down,  and  that
there's nothing (to) horribly wrong with your distribution.
